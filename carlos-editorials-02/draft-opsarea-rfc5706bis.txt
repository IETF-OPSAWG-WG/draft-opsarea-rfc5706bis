Abstract

   New Protocols or Protocol Extensions are best designed with due
   consideration of the functionality needed to operate and manage the
   protocols.  Retrofitting operations and management is sub-optimal.
   The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to authors and
   reviewers of documents that define New Protocols or Protocol
   Extensions regarding aspects of operations and management that should
   be considered.

   This document obsoletes RFC 5706, replacing it completely and
   updating it with new operational and management techniques and
   mechanisms.  It also introduces a requirement for an "Operational and
   Management Considerations" section in Internet-Drafts, before they
   are progressed for publication as RFCs.

1.  Introduction

   Often when New Protocols or Protocol Extensions are developed, not
   enough consideration is given to how the protocol will be deployed,
   operated, and managed.  Retrofitting operations and management
   mechanisms is often hard and architecturally unpleasant, and certain
   protocol design choices may make deployment, operations, and
   management particularly hard.  This document provides guidelines to
   help Protocol Designers and working groups (WGs) consider the
   operations and management functionality for their New Protocol or
   Protocol Extension at an earlier phase.

   This document obsoletes [RFC5706] and fully updates its content with
   new operational and management techniques and mechanisms.  It also
   introduces a requirement for an "Operational and Management
   Considerations" section in Internet-Drafts, before they are
   progressed for publication as RFCs.  Also, the document removes
   outdated references and aligns with current practices, protocols, and
   technologies used in operating and managing devices, networks, and
   services.  See Section 1.5 for more details.

1.1.  Designing for Operations and Management

   The operational environment and manageability of a protocol should be
   considered from the start when New Protocols are designed.

   As the Internet has grown, IETF protocols have addressed a constantly
   growing set of needs, such as web servers, collaboration services,
   and applications.  The number of IETF management technologies has
   been expanding and the IETF management strategy has been changing to
   address the emerging management requirements.  In the past, most of
   the existing IETF management standards were focused on creating MIB
   modules using the Structure of Management Information (SMI)-based
   [STD58] data modeling language, to monitor and manage networking
   devices.  Currently, the YANG data modeling language [RFC7950] is
   recommended to monitor and manage the IETF protocols in devices,
   networks, and network services.  Management requirements continually
   evolve in the IETF.  Therefore, the management protocols used should
   track with current IETF recommendations.

   Protocol Designers should consider which operations and management
   needs are relevant to their protocol, document how those needs could
   be addressed, and suggest (preferably standard) management protocols
   and data models that could be used to address those needs.  This is
   similar to a WG that considers which security threats are relevant to
   their protocol, documents (in the required Security Considerations
   section, per RFC Style Guide [RFC7322]) how threats should be
   mitigated, and then suggests appropriate standard protocols that
   could mitigate the threats.

   When a WG considers operation and management functionality for a
   protocol, the document should contain enough information for readers
   to understand how the protocol will be deployed and managed.  The
   considerations do not need to be comprehensive and exhaustive; focus
   should be on key aspects.  The WG should expect that considerations
   for operations and management may need to be updated in the future,
   after further operational experience has been gained.

   A list of guidelines and a checklist of questions to consider, which
   a reviewer can use to evaluate whether the protocol and documentation
   address common operations and management needs, is provided in
   [CHECKLIST].

1.2.  This Document

   This document makes a distinction between "Operational
   Considerations" and "Management Considerations", although the two are
   closely related.  The operational considerations apply to operating
   the protocol within a network, even if there were no management
   protocol actively being used.  The section on manageability is
   focused on management technology, such as how to utilize management
   protocols and how to design management data models.

   The purpose of this document is to provide guidance about what to
   consider when thinking about the management and deployment of a new
   protocol, and to provide guidance about documenting the
   considerations.  The following guidelines are designed to help
   writers provide a reasonably consistent format for such
   documentation.  Separate manageability and operational considerations
   sections are desirable in many cases, but their structure and
   location are a decision that can be made from case to case.

   This document does not impose a solution, imply that a formal data
   model is needed, or imply that using a specific management protocol
   is mandatory.  If Protocol Designers conclude that the technology can
   be managed solely by using Proprietary Interfaces or that it does not
   need any structured or standardized data model, this might be fine,
   but it is a decision that should be explicit in a manageability
   discussion -- that this is how the protocol will need to be operated
   and managed.  Protocol Designers should avoid having manageability
   pushed for a later phase of the development of the standard.

   A list of guidelines and a checklist of questions to consider, which
   a reviewer can use to evaluate whether the protocol and documentation
   address common operations and management needs, is provided in
   [CHECKLIST].

1.3.  Motivation

   For years the IETF community has used the IETF Standard Management
   Framework, including the Simple Network Management Protocol
   [RFC3410], the Structure of Management Information (SMI) [STD58], and
   MIB Data Models for managing New Protocols.  As the Internet has
   evolved, operators have found the reliance on one protocol and one
   schema language for managing all aspects of the Internet inadequate.
   The IESG policy to require working groups to write a MIB module to
   provide manageability for New Protocols is being replaced by a policy
   that is more open to using a variety of management protocols and data
   models designed to achieve different goals.  In 2014, the IESG wrote
   a statement about "Writable MIB Module" [IESG-STATEMENT].  This
   statement stresses that IETF working groups are encouraged to use the
   NETCONF/YANG standards for configuration, especially in new charters.

   This document provides some initial guidelines for considering
   operations and management in an IETF Management Framework that
   consists of multiple protocols and multiple data modeling languages,
   with an eye toward being flexible while also striving for
   interoperability.

   Fully New Protocols may require significant consideration of expected
   operations and management, while extensions to existing, widely
   deployed protocols may have established de facto operations and
   management practices that are already well understood.

   Suitable management approaches may vary for different areas, working
   groups, and protocols in the IETF.  This document does not prescribe
   a fixed solution or format in dealing with operational and management
   aspects of IETF protocols.  However, these aspects should be
   considered for any IETF protocol because we develop technologies and
   protocols to be deployed and operated in the real-world Internet.  A
   WG may decide that its protocol does not need interoperable
   management or a standardized data model, but this should be a
   deliberate decision, not the result of omission.  This document
   provides some guidelines for those considerations.

1.4.  Background

   There have been a significant number of efforts, meetings, and
   documents that are related to Internet operations and management.
   Some of them are mentioned here to help Protocol Designers find
   documentation of previous efforts.  Hopefully, providing these
   references will help the IETF avoid rehashing old discussions and
   reinventing old solutions.

   In 1988, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) published "IAB
   Recommendations for the Development of Internet Network Management
   Standards" [RFC1052], which recommended a solution that, where
   possible, deliberately separates modeling languages, data models, and
   the protocols that carry data.  The goal is to allow standardized
   information and data models to be used by different protocols.

   In 2001, Operations and Management Area design teams were created to
   document requirements related to the configuration of IP-based
   networks.  One output was "Requirements for Configuration Management
   of IP-based Networks" [RFC3139].

   In 2002, the IAB held a workshop on Network Management [RFC3535] that
   discussed the strengths and weaknesses of some IETF network
   management protocols and compared them to operational needs,
   especially configuration.

   One issue discussed was the user-unfriendliness of the binary format
   of SNMP and Common Open Policy Service (COPS) Usage for Policy
   Provisioning (COPS-PR) [RFC3084], and it was recommended that the
   IETF explore an XML-based Structure of Management Information and an
   XML-based protocol for configuration.

   Another conclusion was that the tools for event/alarm correlation and
   for root cause analysis and logging are not sufficient and that there
   is a need to support a human interface and a programmatic interface.
   The IETF decided to standardize aspects of the de facto standard for
   system-logging security and programmatic support.

   In 2006, the IETF discussed whether the Management Framework should
   be updated to accommodate multiple IETF schema languages for
   describing the structure of management information and multiple IETF
   standard protocols for performing management tasks.  The IESG asked
   that a document be written to discuss how Protocol Designers and
   working groups should address management in this emerging multi-
   protocol environment.  This document and some planned companion
   documents attempt to provide some guidelines for navigating the
   rapidly shifting operating and management environments.

   In 2014, the IESG wrote its statement on "Writable MIB Module"
   [IESG-STATEMENT], as mentioned above.

   In 2024, the IAB held the "Next Era of Network Management Operations
   (NEMOPS)" workshop [NEMOPS-WORKSHOP], building on the previous 2002
   IAB workshop.  Given that much has changed in the Internet’s
   operation and technological foundations since the first workshop, the
   NEMOPS workshop reviewed the past outcomes and discussed any
   operational barriers that prevented these technologies from being
   widely implemented.  With the industry, network operators, and
   protocol engineers working in collaboration, the workshop developed a
   proposed plan of action and provided network management
   recommendations for both the IETF and IRTF.

2.  Key Concepts, Terminology, and Technological Landscape

   This section introduces the key concepts and terminology used
   throughout the document and provides an overview of the relevant
   technological landscape.  It is not intended to offer in-depth
   definitions or explanations; readers seeking more detail should
   consult the referenced materials.

   This document does not describe interoperability requirements.  As
   such, it does not use the capitalized keywords defined in [RFC2119]
   and [RFC8174].

2.1.  Terminology

   These terms are:

   *  Proprietary Interfaces: An interface to manage a network element
      that is not standardized.  As such, the user interface, syntax,
      and semantics typically vary significantly between
      implementations.  Examples of proprietary interfaces include
      Command Line Interface (CLI), management web portal and Browser
      User Interface (BUI), Graphical User Interface (GUI), and vendor-
      specific application programming interface (API).

   *  CLI: Command Line Interface.  Typically, a proprietary interface
      to hardware or software devices (e.g., routers or operating
      systems) for use by human operators directly at a terminal or via
      scripts.  The commands, their syntax, and the precise semantics of
      the parameters may vary considerably between different vendors,
      between products from the same vendor, and even between different
      versions or releases of a single product.  No attempt at
      standardizing CLIs has been made by the IETF.

   *  Information Model: An abstraction and representation of the
      entities in a managed environment, their properties, attributes
      and operations, and the way that they relate to each other.  The
      model is independent of any specific repository, software usage,
      protocol, or platform [RFC3444].  See Section 4.1 and
      Section 4.2.1 for further discussion of information models.

   *  Data Model: A set of mechanisms for representing, organizing,
      storing and handling data within a particular type of data store
      or repository.  This usually comprises a collection of data
      structures such as lists, tables, relations, etc., a collection of
      operations that can be applied to the structures such as
      retrieval, update, summation, etc., and a collection of integrity
      rules that define the legal states (set of values) or changes of
      state (operations on values).  A data model may be derived by
      mapping the contents of an information model or may be developed
      ab initio.  Further discussion of data models can be found in
      [RFC3444], Section 4.1, and Section 4.2.

   *  OAM: Operations, Administration, and Maintenance [RFC6291]
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-oam-characterization] is the term given to the
      combination of:

      1.  Operation activities that are undertaken to keep the network.
          They include monitoring of the network.

      2.  Administration activities that keep track of resources in the
          network and how they are used.  They include the bookkeeping
          necessary to track networking resources.

      3.  Maintenance activities focused on facilitating repairs and
          upgrades.  They also involve corrective and preventive
          measures to make the managed network run more effectively.

      The broader concept of "operations and management" that is the
      subject of this document encompasses OAM along with other
      management and provisioning tools and concepts.

   *  New Protocol and Protocol Extension: These terms are used in this
      document to identify entirely new Internet protocols, new versions
      of existing Internet protocols, and extensions to Internet
      protocols.

   *  Protocol Designer: This term is used to refer to an individual, a
      group of people, or an IETF Working Group involved in the
      development and specification of New Protocols or Protocol
      Extensions.

   *  Problem: See [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   *  Fault: See [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   *  Fault management: Fault management is the process of interpreting
      fault notifications and other alerts and alarms, isolating faults,
      correlating them, and deducing underlying causes.  See Section 4.3
      for more information.

   *  Anomaly: See [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   *  Cause: See [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   *  Root Cause: Since one fault may give rise to another, a root cause
      Section 4.3.3 is commonly meant to describe the original event
      that is the foundation of all related faults.

2.2.  Available Management Technologies

   The IETF has a number of standard management protocols available that
   are suitable for different purposes.  These include:

   *  Syslog [RFC5424]

   *  Network Configuration Protocol - NETCONF [RFC6241]

   *  RESTCONF [RFC8040]

   *  Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service - RADIUS [RFC2865]

   *  DIAMETER [RFC6733]

   *  IP Flow Information Export - IPFIX [RFC7011]

   *  BGP Monitoring Protocol - BMP [RFC7854]

   The IETF previously also worked on the Simple Network Management
   Protocol (SNMP) [RFC3410] and the Structure of Management Information
   (SMI) [STD58], but further use of this management protocol in new
   IETF documents has been constrained to maintenance of existing MIB
   modules and development of MIB modules for legacy devices that do not
   support more resent management protocols [IESG-STATEMENT].

   A planned supplement to this document will discuss these protocol
   standards, discuss some standard information and Data Models for
   specific functionality, and provide pointers to the documents that
   define them.

3.  Operational Considerations - How Will the New Protocol Fit into the
    Current Environment?

   Designers of a New Protocol should carefully consider the operational
   aspects.  To ensure that a protocol will be practical to deploy in
   the real world, it is not enough to merely define it very precisely
   in a well-written document.  Operational aspects will have a serious
   impact on the actual success of a protocol.  Such aspects include bad
   interactions with existing solutions, a difficult upgrade path,
   difficulty of debugging problems, difficulty configuring from a
   central database, or a complicated state diagram that operations
   staff will find difficult to understand.

   BGP flap damping [RFC2439] is an example.  It was designed to block
   high-frequency route flaps; however, the design did not consider the
   existence of BGP path exploration / slow convergence.  In real
   operations, path exploration caused false flap damping, resulting in
   loss of reachability.  As a result, many networks turned flap damping
   off.

3.1.  Operations

   Protocol Designers can analyze the operational environment and mode
   of work in which the New Protocol and Protocol Extension will work.
   Such an exercise need not be reflected directly by text in their
   document but could help in visualizing how to apply the protocol in
   the Internet environments where it will be deployed.

   A key question is how the protocol can operate "out of the box".  If
   implementers are free to select their own defaults, the protocol
   needs to operate well with any choice of values.  If there are
   sensible defaults, these need to be stated.

   There may be a need to support both a human interface (e.g., for
   troubleshooting) and a programmatic interface (e.g., for automated
   monitoring and root cause analysis).  The application programming
   interfaces (APIs) and the human interfaces might benefit from being
   similar to ensure that the information exposed by both is consistent
   when presented to an operator.  Identifying consistent methods for
   determining information, such as what is counted in a specific
   counter, is relevant.

   Protocol Designers should consider what management operations are
   expected to be performed as a result of the deployment of the
   protocol -- such as whether write operations will be allowed on
   routers and on hosts, or whether notifications for alarms or other
   events will be expected.

3.2.  Installation and Initial Setup

   Anything that can be configured can be misconfigured.  "Architectural
   Principles of the Internet" [RFC1958], Section 3.8, states: "Avoid
   options and parameters whenever possible.  Any options and parameters
   should be configured or negotiated dynamically rather than manually".

   To simplify configuration, Protocol Designers should consider
   specifying reasonable defaults, including default modes and
   parameters.  For example, it could be helpful or necessary to specify
   default values for modes, timers, default state of logical control
   variables, default transports, and so on.  Even if default values are
   used, it must be possible to retrieve all the actual values or at
   least an indication that known default values are being used.

   Protocol Designers should consider how to enable operators to
   concentrate on the configuration of the network as a whole rather
   than on individual devices.  Of course, how one accomplishes this is
   the hard part.

   It is desirable to discuss the background of chosen default values,
   or perhaps why a range of values makes sense.  In many cases, as
   technology changes, the values in an RFC might make less and less
   sense.  It is very useful to understand whether defaults are based on
   best current practice and are expected to change as technologies
   advance or whether they have a more universal value that should not
   be changed lightly.  For example, the default interface speed might
   be expected to change over time due to increased speeds in the
   network, and cryptographical algorithms might be expected to change
   over time as older algorithms are "broken".

   It is extremely important to set a sensible default value for all
   parameters.

   The default value should stay on the conservative side rather than on
   the "optimizing performance" side (example: the initial RTT and
   RTTVAR values of a TCP connection).

   For those parameters that are speed-dependent, instead of using a
   constant, try to set the default value as a function of the link
   speed or some other relevant factors.  This would help reduce the
   chance of problems caused by technology advancement.

3.3.  Migration Path

   If the New Protocol is a new version of an existing one, or if it is
   replacing another technology, the Protocol Designer should consider
   how deployments should transition to the New Protocol or Protocol
   Extensions.  This should include coexistence with previously deployed
   protocols and/or previous versions of the same protocol,
   incompatibilities between versions, translation between versions, and
   side effects that might occur.  Are older protocols or versions
   disabled, or do they coexist in the network with the New Protocol?

   Many protocols benefit from being incrementally deployable --
   operators may deploy aspects of a protocol before deploying the
   protocol fully.

3.4.  Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components

   Protocol Designers should consider the requirements that the new
   protocol might put on other protocols and functional components and
   should also document the requirements from other protocols and
   functional elements that have been considered in designing the new
   protocol.

   These considerations should generally remain illustrative to avoid
   creating restrictions or dependencies, or potentially impacting the
   behavior of existing protocols, or restricting the extensibility of
   other protocols, or assuming other protocols will not be extended in
   certain ways.  If restrictions or dependencies exist, they should be
   stated.

   For example, the design of the Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP)
   [RFC2205] required each router to look at the RSVP PATH message and,
   if the router understood RSVP, add its own address to the message to
   enable automatic tunneling through non-RSVP routers.  But in reality,
   routers cannot look at an otherwise normal IP packet and potentially
   take it off the fast path!  The initial designers overlooked that a
   new "deep packet inspection" requirement was being put on the
   functional components of a router.  The "router alert" option
   ([RFC2113], [RFC2711]) was finally developed to solve this problem
   for RSVP and other protocols that require the router to take some
   packets off the fast-forwarding path.  Yet, router alert has its own
   problems in impacting router performance.

3.5.  Impact on Network Operation

   The introduction of a New Protocol or Protocol Extensions to an
   existing protocol may have an impact on the operation of existing
   networks.  Protocol Designers should outline such impacts (which may
   be positive), including scaling concerns and interactions with other
   protocols.  For example, a New Protocol that doubles the number of
   active, reachable addresses in use within a network might need to be
   considered in the light of the impact on the scalability of the
   interior gateway protocols operating within the network.

   A protocol could send active monitoring packets on the wire.  If we
   don't pay attention, we might get very good accuracy but could send
   too many active monitoring packets.

   The Protocol Designer should consider the potential impact on the
   behavior of other protocols in the network and on the traffic levels
   and traffic patterns that might change, including specific types of
   traffic, such as multicast.  Also, consider the need to install new
   components that are added to the network as a result of changes in
   the configuration, such as servers performing auto-configuration
   operations.

   The Protocol Designer should consider also the impact on
   infrastructure applications like DNS [RFC1034], the registries, or
   the size of routing tables.  For example, Simple Mail Transfer
   Protocol (SMTP) [RFC5321] servers use a reverse DNS lookup to filter
   out incoming connection requests.  When Berkeley installed a new spam
   filter, their mail server stopped functioning because of overload of
   the DNS cache resolver.

   The impact on performance may also be noted -- increased delay or
   jitter in real-time traffic applications, or increased response time
   in client-server applications when encryption or filtering are
   applied.

   It is important to minimize the impact caused by configuration
   changes.  Given configuration A and configuration B, it should be
   possible to generate the operations necessary to get from A to B with
   minimal state changes and effects on network and systems.

3.6.  Verifying Correct Operation

   The Protocol Designer should consider techniques for testing the
   effect that the protocol has had on the network by sending data
   through the network and observing its behavior (a.k.a., active
   monitoring).  Protocol Designers should consider how the correct end-
   to-end operation of the New Protocol or Protocol Extension in the
   network can be tested actively and passively, and how the correct
   data or forwarding plane function of each network element can be
   verified to be working properly with the New Protocol.  Which metrics
   are of interest?

   Having simple protocol status and health indicators on network
   devices is a recommended means to check correct operation.

4.  Management Considerations - How Will the Protocol Be Managed?

   The considerations of manageability should start from identifying the
   entities to be managed, as well as how the managed protocol is
   supposed to be installed, configured, and monitored.

   Considerations for management should include a discussion of what
   needs to be managed, and how to achieve various management tasks.
   Where are the managers and what type of interfaces and protocols will
   they need?  The "write a MIB module" approach to considering
   management often focuses on monitoring a protocol endpoint on a
   single device.  A MIB module document typically only considers
   monitoring properties observable at one end, while the document does
   not really cover managing the *protocol* (the coordination of
   multiple ends) and does not even come near managing the *service*
   (which includes a lot of stuff that is very far away from the box).
   This scenario reflects a common operational concern: the inability to
   manage both ends of a connection effectively.  As noted in [RFC3535],
   "MIB modules can often be characterized as a list of ingredients
   without a recipe".

   The management model should take into account factors such as:

   *  What type of management entities will be involved (agents, network
      management systems)?

   *  What is the possible architecture (client-server, manager-agent,
      poll-driven or event-driven, auto-configuration, two levels or
      hierarchical)?

   *  What are the management operations (initial configuration, dynamic
      configuration, alarm and exception reporting, logging, performance
      monitoring, performance reporting, debugging)?

   *  How are these operations performed (locally, remotely, atomic
      operation, scripts)?  Are they performed immediately or are they
      time scheduled, or event triggered?

   Protocol Designers should consider how the New Protocol or Protocol
   Extension will be managed in different deployment scales.  It might
   be sensible to use a local management interface to manage the New
   Protocol on a single device, but in a large network, remote
   management using a centralized server and/or using distributed
   management functionality might make more sense.  Auto-configuration
   and default parameters might be possible for some New Protocols.

   Management needs to be considered not only from the perspective of a
   device, but also from the perspective of network and service
   management.  A service might be network and operational functionality
   derived from the implementation and deployment of a New Protocol.
   Often an individual network element is not aware of the service being
   delivered.

   WGs should consider how to configure multiple related/co-operating
   devices and how to back off if one of those configurations fails or
   causes trouble.  NETCONF addresses this in a generic manner by
   allowing an operator to lock the configuration on multiple devices,
   perform the configuration settings/changes, check that they are OK
   (undo if not), and then unlock the devices.

   Techniques for debugging protocol interactions in a network must be
   part of the network-management discussion.  Implementation source
   code should be debugged before ever being added to a network, so
   asserts and memory dumps do not normally belong in management data
   models.  However, debugging on-the-wire interactions is a protocol
   issue: while the messages can be seen by sniffing, it is enormously
   helpful if a protocol specification supports features that make
   debugging of network interactions and behaviors easier.  There could
   be alerts issued when messages are received or when there are state
   transitions in the protocol state machine.  However, the state
   machine is often not part of the on-the-wire protocol; the state
   machine explains how the protocol works so that an implementer can
   decide, in an implementation-specific manner, how to react to a
   received event.

   In a client/server protocol, it may be more important to instrument
   the server end of a protocol than the client end, since the
   performance of the server might impact more nodes than the
   performance of a specific client.

4.1.  Interoperability

   Just as when deploying protocols that will inter-connect devices,
   management interoperability should be considered -- whether across
   devices from different vendors, across models from the same vendor,
   or across different releases of the same product.  Management
   interoperability refers to allowing information sharing and
   operations between multiple devices and multiple management
   applications, often from different vendors.  Interoperability allows
   for the use of third-party applications and the outsourcing of
   management services.

   Some product designers and Protocol Designers assume that if a device
   can be managed individually using a command line interface or a web
   page interface, that such a solution is enough.  But when equipment
   from multiple vendors is combined into a large network, scalability
   of management may become a problem.  It may be important to have
   consistency in the management protocol support so network-wide
   operational processes can be automated.  For example, a single switch
   might be easily managed using an interactive web interface when
   installed in a single-office small business, but when, say, a fast-
   food company installs similar switches from multiple vendors in
   hundreds or thousands of individual branches and wants to automate
   monitoring them from a central location, monitoring vendor- and
   model-specific web pages would be difficult to automate.

   The primary goal is the ability to roll out new useful functions and
   services in a way in which they can be managed in a scalable manner,
   where one understands the network impact (as part of the total cost
   of operations) of that service.

   Getting everybody to agree on a single syntax and an associated
   protocol to do all management has proven to be difficult.  So,
   management systems tend to speak whatever the boxes support, whether
   the IETF likes this.  The IETF is moving from support for one schema
   language for modeling the structure of management information (SMIv2)
   and one simple network management protocol (SNMP) towards support for
   additional schema languages and additional management protocols
   suited to different purposes.  Other Standard Development
   Organizations (e.g., the Distributed Management Task Force - DMTF,
   the Tele-Management Forum - TMF) also define schemas and protocols
   for management and these may be more suitable than IETF schemas and
   protocols in some cases.  Some of the alternatives being considered
   include:

   *  XML Schema Definition [W3C.REC-xmlschema-0-20041028]

   and

   *  NETCONF Configuration Protocol [RFC6241]

   *  the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol [RFC7011]) for
      usage accounting

   *  the syslog protocol [RFC5424] for logging

   Interoperability needs to be considered on the syntactic level and
   the semantic level.  While it can be irritating and time-consuming,
   application designers, including operators who write their own
   scripts, can make their processing conditional to accommodate
   syntactic differences across vendors, models, or releases of product.

   Semantic differences are much harder to deal with on the manager side
   -- once you have the data, its meaning is a function of the managed
   entity.

   Information models are helpful to try to focus interoperability on
   the semantic level -- they define what information should be gathered
   and how that information might be used, regardless of which
   management protocol carries the data or which vendor implementation
   produces the data.  The use of an Information Model might help
   improve the ability of operators to correlate messages in different
   protocols where the data overlaps, such as a YANG Data Model and
   IPFIX Information Elements about the same event.  An Information
   Model might identify which error conditions should be counted
   separately, and which error conditions can be recorded together in a
   single counter.  Then, whether the counter is gathered via, e.g.,
   NETCONF or exported via IPFIX, the counter will have the same
   meaning.

   Protocol Designers must consider what operational, configuration,
   state, or statistical information will be relevant for effectively
   monitoring, controlling, or troubleshooting a New Protocol and its
   Protocol Extensions.  This includes identifying key parameters that
   reflect the protocol’s behavior, performance metrics, error
   indicators, and any contextual data that would aid in diagnostic,
   troubleshooting, or lifecycle management.

           Figure 1: Information Models（IMs）and Data Models（DMs）

   "On the Difference between Information Models and Data Models"
   [RFC3444] is helpful in determining what information to consider
   regarding Information Models (IMs), as compared to Data Models (DMs).

   Protocol Designers may directly develop Data Models without first
   producing an Information Model.  For example, such a decision can be
   taken when it is given that the data component is not used by
   distinct protocols (e.g., IPFIX-only).

   Alternatively, Protocol Designers may decide to use an Information
   Model to describe the managed elements in a protocol or Protocol
   Extension.  The protocol Designers then use the Information Model to
   develop Data Models that will be used for managing the protocol.

   Specifically, Protocol Designers should develop an Information Model
   if multiple Data Model representations (e.g., YANG [RFC6020][RFC7950]
   and/or IPFIX [RFC7011]) are to be produced, to ensure lossless
   semantic mapping.  Protocol Designers may create an Information Model
   if the resulting Data Models are complex or numerous.

   Information models should come from the protocol WGs and include
   lists of events, counters, and configuration parameters that are
   relevant.  There are a number of information models contained in
   protocol WG RFCs.  Some examples:

   *  [RFC3060] - Policy Core Information Model -- Version 1
      Specification

   *  [RFC3290] - An Informal Management Model for Diffserv Routers

   *  [RFC3460] - Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions

   *  [RFC3585] - IPsec Configuration Policy Information Model

   *  [RFC3644] - Policy Quality of Service (QoS) Information Model

   *  [RFC3670] - Information Model for Describing Network Device QoS
      Datapath Mechanisms

   Management protocol standards and management Data Model standards
   often contain compliance clauses to ensure interoperability.
   Manageability considerations should include discussion of which level
   of compliance is expected to be supported for interoperability.

4.2.  Management Information

   Languages used to describe an Information Model can influence the
   nature of the model.  Using a particular data modeling language, such
   as YANG, influences the model to use certain types of structures, for
   example, hierarchical trees, groupings, and reusable types.  YANG, as
   described in [RFC6020] and [RFC7950], provides advantages for
   expressing network information, including clear separation of
   configuration data and operational state, support for constraints and
   dependencies, and extensibility for evolving requirements.  Its
   ability to represent relationships and dependencies in a structured
   and modular way makes it an effective choice for defining management
   information models.

   Although this document recommends using English text (the official
   language for IETF specifications) to describe an Information Model,
   including a complementary YANG module helps translate abstract
   concepts into implementation-specific Data Models.  This ensures
   consistency between the high-level design and practical deployment.

   A management Information Model should include a discussion of what is
   manageable, which aspects of the protocol need to be configured, what
   types of operations are allowed, what protocol-specific events might
   occur, which events can be counted, and for which events an operator
   should be notified.

   Operators find it important to be able to make a clear distinction
   between configuration data, operational state, and statistics.  They
   need to determine which parameters were administratively configured
   and which parameters have changed since configuration as the result
   of mechanisms such as routing protocols or network management
   protocols.  It is important to be able to separately fetch current
   configuration information, initial configuration information,
   operational state information, and statistics from devices; to be
   able to compare current state to initial state; and to compare
   information between devices.  So, when deciding what information
   should exist, do not conflate multiple information elements into a
   single element.

   What is typically difficult to work through are relationships between
   abstract objects.  Ideally, an Information Model would describe the
   relationships between the objects and concepts in the information
   model.

   Is there always just one instance of this object or can there be
   multiple instances?  Does this object relate to exactly one other
   object, or may it relate to multiple?  When is it possible to change
   a relationship?

   Do objects (such as instances in lists) share fate?  For example, if
   an instance in list A must exist before a related instance in list B
   can be created, what happens to the instance in list B if the related
   instance in list A is deleted?  Does the existence of relationships
   between objects have an impact on fate sharing?  YANG's relationships
   and constraints can help express and enforce these relationships.

4.2.1.  Information Model Design

   This document recommends keeping the Information Model as simple as
   possible by applying the following criteria:

   1.  Start with a small set of essential objects and make additions
       only as further objects are needed with the objective of keeping
       the absolute number of objects as small as possible while still
       delivering the required function such that there is no
       duplication between objects and where one piece of information
       can be derived from the other pieces of information, it is not
       itself represented as an object.

   2.  Require that all objects be essential for management.

   3.  Consider evidence of current use of the managed protocol, and the
       perceived utility of objects added to the Information Model.

   4.  Exclude objects that can be derived from others in this or other
       information models.

   5.  Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily instrumented.  A
       guideline is one counter per critical section per layer.

   6.  When defining an Information Model using YANG Data Structure
       Extensions [RFC8791] (thereby keeping it abstract and
       implementation-agnostic per [RFC3444]) ensure that the
       Information Model remains simple, modular, and clear by following
       the authoring guidelines in [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   7.  When illustrating the abstract Information Model, use YANG Tree
       Diagrams [RFC8340] to provide a simple, standardized, and
       implementation-neutral model structure.

4.2.2.  YANG Data Model Considerations

   When considering YANG Data Models for a new specification, there are
   multiple types of Data Models that may be applicable.  The hierarchy
   and relationship between these types is described in Section 3.5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].  A new specification may require or
   benefit from one or more of these YANG Data Model types.

   *  Device Models - Also called Network Element Models, represent the
      configuration, operational state, and notifications of individual
      devices.  These models are designed to distinguish between these
      types of data and support querying and updating device-specific
      parameters.  Consideration should be given to how device-level
      models might fit with broader network and service Data Models.

   *  Network Models - Also called Network Service Models, define
      abstractions for managing the behavior and relationships of
      multiple devices and device subsystems within a network.  As
      described in [RFC8199], these models are used to manage network-
      wide.  These abstractions are useful to network operators and
      applications that interface with network controllers.  Examples of
      network models include the L3VPN Network Model (L3NM) [RFC9182]
      and the L2VPN Network Model (L2VPN) [RFC9291].

   *  Service Models - Also called Customer Service Models, defined in
      [RFC8309], are designed to abstract the customer interface into a
      service.  They consider customer-centric parameters such as
      Service Level Agreement (SLA) and high-level policy (e.g., network
      intent).  Given that different operators and different customers
      may have widely-varying business processes, these models should
      focus on common aspects of a service with strong multi-party
      consensus.  Examples of service models include the L3VPN Service
      Model (L3SM) [RFC8299] and the L2VPN Service Model (L2SM)
      [RFC8499].

   A common challenge in YANG Data Model development lies in defining
   the relationships between abstract service or network constructs and
   the underlying device models.  Therefore, when designing YANG
   modules, it is important to go beyond simply modeling configuration
   and operational data (i.e., leaf nodes), and also consider how the
   status and relationships of abstract or distributed constructs can be
   reflected based on parameters available in the network.

   For example, the status of a service may depend on the operational
   state of multiple network elements to which the service is attached.
   In such cases, the YANG Data Model (and its accompanying
   documentation) should clearly describe how service-level status is
   derived from underlying device-level information.  Similarly, it is
   beneficial to define events (and relevant triggered notifications)
   that indicate changes in an underlying state, enabling reliable
   detection and correlation of service-affecting conditions.  Including
   such mechanisms improves the robustness of integrations and helps
   ensure consistent behavior across implementations.

   Specific guidelines to consider when authoring any type of YANG
   modules are described in [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

4.3.  Fault Management

   The Protocol Designer should document the basic faults and health
   indicators that need to be instrumented for the New Protocol or
   Protocol Extension, as well as the alarms and events that must be
   propagated to management applications or exposed through a Data
   Model.

   The Protocol Designer should consider how fault information will be
   propagated.  Will it be done using asynchronous notifications or
   polling of health indicators?

   If notifications are used to alert operators to certain conditions,
   then the Protocol Designer should discuss mechanisms to throttle
   notifications to prevent congestion and duplications of event
   notifications.  Will there be a hierarchy of faults, and will the
   fault reporting be done by each fault in the hierarchy, or will only
   the lowest fault be reported and the higher levels be suppressed?
   Should there be aggregated status indicators based on concatenation
   of propagated faults from a given domain or device?

   SNMP notifications and syslog messages can alert an operator when an
   aspect of the New Protocol fails or encounters an error or failure
   condition, and SNMP is frequently used as a heartbeat monitor.
   Should the event reporting provide guaranteed accurate delivery of
   the event information within a given (high) margin of confidence?
   Can we poll the latest events in the box?

4.3.1.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Protocol Designers should always build in basic testing features
   (e.g., ICMP echo, UDP/TCP echo service, NULL RPCs (remote procedure
   calls)) that can be used to test for liveness, with an option to
   enable and disable them.

   Mechanisms for monitoring the liveness of the protocol and for
   detecting faults in protocol connectivity are usually built into
   protocols.  In some cases, mechanisms already exist within other
   protocols responsible for maintaining lower-layer connectivity (e.g.,
   ICMP echo), but often new procedures are required to detect failures
   and to report rapidly, allowing remedial action to be taken.

   These liveness monitoring mechanisms do not typically require
   additional management capabilities.  However, when a system detects a
   fault, there is often a requirement to coordinate recovery action
   through management applications or at least to record the fact in an
   event log.

4.3.2.  Fault Determination

   It can be helpful to describe how faults can be pinpointed using
   management information.  For example, counters might record instances
   of error conditions.  Some faults might be able to be pinpointed by
   comparing the outputs of one device and the inputs of another device,
   looking for anomalies.  Protocol Designers should consider what
   counters should count.  If a single counter provided by vendor A
   counts three types of error conditions, while the corresponding
   counter provided by vendor B counts seven types of error conditions,
   these counters cannot be compared effectively -- they are not
   interoperable counters.

   How do you distinguish between faulty messages and good messages?

   Would some threshold-based mechanisms, such as Remote Monitoring
   (RMON) events/alarms or the EVENT-MIB, be usable to help determine
   error conditions?  Are SNMP notifications for all events needed, or
   are there some "standard" notifications that could be used?  Or can
   relevant counters be polled as needed?

4.3.3.  Root Cause Analysis

   Root cause analysis is about working out where in the network the
   fault is.  For example, if end-to-end data delivery is failing
   (reported by a notification), root cause analysis can help find the
   failed link or node in the end-to-end path.

4.3.4.  Fault Isolation

   It might be useful to isolate or quarantine faults, such as isolating
   a device that emits malformed messages that are necessary to
   coordinate connections properly.  This might be able to be done by
   configuring next-hop devices to drop the faulty messages to prevent
   them from entering the rest of the network.

4.4.  Configuration Management

   A Protocol Designer should document the basic configuration
   parameters that need to be instrumented for a New Protocol or
   Protocol Extensions, as well as default values and modes of
   operation.

   What information should be maintained across reboots of the device,
   or restarts of the management system?

   "Requirements for Configuration Management of IP-based Networks"
   [RFC3139] discusses requirements for configuration management,
   including discussion of different levels of management, high-level
   policies, network-wide configuration data, and device-local
   configuration.  Network configuration is not just multi-device push
   or pull.  It is knowing that the configurations being pushed are
   semantically compatible.  Is the circuit between them configured
   compatibly on both ends?  Is the IS-IS metric the same? ... Now
   answer those questions for 1,000 devices.

   A number of efforts have existed in the IETF to develop policy-based
   configuration management.  "Terminology for Policy-Based Management"
   [RFC3198] was written to standardize the terminology across these
   efforts.

   Implementations should not arbitrarily modify configuration data.  In
   some cases (such as access control lists (ACLs)), the order of data
   items is significant and comprises part of the configured data.  If a
   Protocol Designer defines mechanisms for configuration, it would be
   desirable to standardize the order of elements for consistency of
   configuration and of reporting across vendors and across releases
   from vendors.

   There are two parts to this:

   1.  A Network Management System (NMS) could optimize ACLs for
       performance reasons.

   2.  Unless the device or NMS is configured with proper rules and
       guided by administrators with extensive experience, reordering
       ACLs can introduce significant security risks.

   Network-wide configurations may be stored in central master databases
   and transformed into readable formats that can be pushed to devices,
   either by generating sequences of CLI commands or complete textual
   configuration files that are pushed to devices.  There is no common
   database schema for network configuration, although the models used
   by various operators are probably very similar.  Many operators
   consider it desirable to extract, document, and standardize the
   common parts of these network- wide configuration database schemas.
   A Protocol Designer should consider how to standardize the common
   parts of configuring the new protocol, while recognizing that vendors
   may also have proprietary aspects of their configurations.

   It is important to enable operators to concentrate on the
   configuration of the network as a whole, rather than individual
   devices.  Support for configuration transactions across a number of
   devices could significantly simplify network configuration
   management.  The ability to distribute configurations to multiple
   devices, or to modify candidate configurations on multiple devices,
   and then activate them in a near-simultaneous manner might help.
   Protocol Designers can consider how it would make sense for their
   protocol to be configured across multiple devices.  Configuration
   templates might also be helpful.

   Consensus of the 2002 IAB Workshop [RFC3535] was that textual
   configuration files should be able to contain international
   characters.  Human-readable strings should utilize UTF-8, and
   protocol elements should be in case-insensitive ASCII.

   A mechanism to dump and restore configurations is a primitive
   operation needed by operators.  Standards for pulling and pushing
   configurations from/to devices are desirable.

   Given configuration A and configuration B, it should be possible to
   generate the operations necessary to get from A to B with minimal
   state changes and effects on network and systems.  It is important to
   minimize the impact caused by configuration changes.

   A Protocol Designer should consider the configurable items that exist
   for the control of function via the protocol elements described in
   the protocol specification.  For example, sometimes the protocol
   requires that timers can be configured by the operator to ensure
   specific policy-based behavior by the implementation.  These timers
   should have default values suggested in the protocol specification
   and may not need to be otherwise configurable.

4.4.1.  Verifying Correct Operation

   An important function that should be provided is guidance on how to
   verify the correct operation of a protocol.  A Protocol Designer
   could suggest techniques for testing the impact of the protocol on
   the network before it is deployed as well as techniques for testing
   the effect that the protocol has had on the network after being
   deployed.

   Protocol Designers should consider how to test the correct end-to-end
   operation of the service or network, how to verify the correct
   functioning of the protocol, and whether that is verified by testing
   the service function and/or by testing the forwarding function of
   each network element.  This may be achieved through status and
   statistical information gathered from devices.

4.5.  Accounting Management

   A Protocol Designer should consider whether it would be appropriate
   to collect usage information related to this protocol and, if so,
   what usage information would be appropriate to collect.

   "Introduction to Accounting Management" [RFC2975] discusses a number
   of factors relevant to monitoring usage of protocols for purposes of
   capacity and trend analysis, cost allocation, auditing, and billing.
   The document also discusses how some existing protocols can be used
   for these purposes.  These factors should be considered when
   designing a protocol whose usage might need to be monitored or when
   recommending a protocol to do usage accounting.

4.6.  Performance Management

   From a manageability point of view, it is important to determine how
   well a network deploying the protocol or technology defined in the
   document is doing.  In order to do this, the network operators need
   to consider information that would be useful to determine the
   performance characteristics of a deployed system using the target
   protocol.

   The IETF, via the Benchmarking Methodology WG (BMWG), has defined
   recommendations for the measurement of the performance
   characteristics of various internetworking technologies in a
   laboratory environment, including the systems or services that are
   built from these technologies.  Each benchmarking recommendation
   describes the class of equipment, system, or service being addressed;
   discusses the performance characteristics that are pertinent to that
   class; clearly identifies a set of metrics that aid in the
   description of those characteristics; specifies the methodologies
   required to collect said metrics; and lastly, presents the
   requirements for the common, unambiguous reporting of benchmarking
   results.  Search for "benchmark" in the RFC search tool.

   Performance metrics may be useful in multiple environments and for
   different protocols.  The IETF, via the IP Performance Monitoring
   (IPPM) WG, has developed a set of standard metrics that can be
   applied to the quality, performance, and reliability of Internet data
   delivery services.  These metrics are designed such that they can be
   performed by network operators, end users, or independent testing
   groups.  The existing metrics might be applicable to the new
   protocol.  Search for "metric" in the RFC search tool.  In some
   cases, new metrics need to be defined.  It would be useful if the
   protocol documentation identified the need for such new metrics.  For
   performance monitoring, it is often important to report the time
   spent in a state, rather than reporting the current state.  Snapshots
   are of less value for performance monitoring.

   There are several parts to performance management to be considered:
   protocol monitoring, device monitoring (the impact of the new
   protocol / service activation on the device), network monitoring, and
   service monitoring (the impact of service activation on the network).

4.6.1.  Monitoring the Protocol

   Certain properties of protocols are useful to monitor.  The number of
   protocol packets received, the number of packets sent, and the number
   of packets dropped are usually very helpful to operators.

   Packet drops should be reflected in counter variable(s) somewhere
   that can be inspected -- both from the security point of view and
   from the troubleshooting point of view.

   Counter definitions should be unambiguous about what is included in
   the count and what is not included in the count.

   Consider the expected behaviors for counters -- what is a reasonable
   maximum value for expected usage?  Should they stop counting at the
   maximum value and retain the maximum value, or should they rollover?
   How can users determine if a rollover has occurred, and how can users
   determine if more than one rollover has occurred?

   Consider whether multiple management applications will share a
   counter; if so, then no one management application should be allowed
   to reset the value to zero since this will impact other applications.

   Could events, such as hot-swapping a blade in a chassis, cause
   discontinuities in counter?  Does this make any difference in
   evaluating the performance of a protocol?

   The protocol specification should clearly define any inherent
   limitations and describe expected behavior when those limits are
   exceeded.  These considerations should be made independently of any
   specific management protocol or data modeling language.  In other
   words, focus on what makes sense for the protocol being managed, not
   the protocol used for management.  If a constraint is not specific to
   a management protocol, then it should be left to data modelers of
   that protocol to determine how to handle it.  For example, VLAN
   identifiers are defined by standard to range from 1 to 4094.
   Therefore, a YANG vlan-id definition representing the 12-bit VLAN ID
   used in the VLAN Tag header uses a range of "1..4094".

4.6.2.  Monitoring the Device

   Consider whether device performance will be affected by the number of
   protocol entities being instantiated on the device.  Designers of an
   Information Model should include information, accessible at runtime,
   about the maximum number of instances an implementation can support,
   the current number of instances, and the expected behavior when the
   current instances exceed the capacity of the implementation or the
   capacity of the device.

   Designers of an Information Model should model information,
   accessible at runtime, about the maximum number of protocol entity
   instances an implementation can support on a device, the current
   number of instances, and the expected behavior when the current
   instances exceed the capacity of the device.

4.6.3.  Monitoring the Network

   Consider whether network performance will be affected by the number
   of protocol entities being deployed.

   Consider the capability of determining the operational activity, such
   as the number of messages in and the messages out, the number of
   received messages rejected due to format problems, and the expected
   behaviors when a malformed message is received.

   What are the principal performance factors that need to be considered
   when measuring the operational performance of a network built using
   the protocol?  Is it important to measure setup times, end-to-end
   connectivity, hop-by-hop connectivity, or network throughput?

4.6.4.  Monitoring the Service

   What are the principal performance factors that need to be considered
   when measuring the performance of a service using the protocol?  Is
   it important to measure application-specific throughput, client-
   server associations, end-to-end application quality, service
   interruptions, or user experience (UX)?

4.7.  Security Management

   Protocol Designers should consider how to monitor and manage security
   aspects and vulnerabilities of the New Protocol or Protocol
   Extension.

   There will be security considerations related to the New Protocol.
   To make it possible for operators to be aware of security-related
   events, it is recommended that system logs should record events, such
   as failed logins, but the logs must be secured.

   Should a system automatically notify operators of every event
   occurrence, or should an operator-defined threshold control when a
   notification is sent to an operator?

   Should certain statistics be collected about the operation of the new
   protocol that might be useful for detecting attacks, such as the
   receipt of malformed messages, messages out of order, or messages
   with invalid timestamps?  If such statistics are collected, is it
   important to count them separately for each sender to help identify
   the source of attacks?

   Manageability considerations that are security-oriented might include
   discussion of the security implications when no monitoring is in
   place, the regulatory implications of absence of audit-trail or logs
   in enterprises, exceeding the capacity of logs, and security
   exposures present in chosen/recommended management mechanisms.

   Consider security threats that may be introduced by management
   operations.  For example, Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access
   Points (CAPWAP) breaks the structure of monolithic Access Points
   (APs) into Access Controllers and Wireless Termination Points (WTPs).
   By using a control protocol or management protocol, internal
   information that was previously not accessible is now exposed over
   the network and to management applications and may become a source of
   potential security threats.

   The granularity of access control needed on management interfaces
   needs to match operational needs.  Typical requirements are a role-
   based access control model and the principle of least privilege,
   where a user can be given only the minimum access necessary to
   perform a required task.

   Some operators wish to do consistency checks of access control lists
   across devices.  Protocol Designers should consider information
   models to promote comparisons across devices and across vendors to
   permit checking the consistency of security configurations.

   Protocol Designers should consider how to provide a secure transport,
   authentication, identity, and access control that integrates well
   with existing key and credential management infrastructure.  It is a
   good idea to start with defining the threat model for the protocol,
   and from that deducing what is required.

   Protocol Designers should consider how access control lists are
   maintained and updated.

   Standard SNMP notifications or syslog messages might already exist,
   or can be defined, to alert operators to the conditions identified in
   the security considerations for the new protocol.  For example, you
   can log all the commands entered by the operator using syslog (giving
   you some degree of audit trail), or you can see who has logged on/off
   using the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol [RFC4251] and from where;
   failed SSH logins can be logged using syslog, etc.

   An analysis of existing counters might help operators recognize the
   conditions identified in the security considerations for the new
   protocol before they can impact the network.

   Different management protocols use different assumptions about
   message security and data-access controls.  A Protocol Designer that
   recommends using different protocols should consider how security
   will be applied in a balanced manner across multiple management
   interfaces.  SNMP authority levels and policy are data-oriented,
   while CLI authority levels and policy are usually command-oriented
   (i.e., task-oriented).  Depending on the management function,
   sometimes data-oriented or task-oriented approaches make more sense.
   Protocol Designers should consider both data-oriented and task-
   oriented authority levels and policy.

5.  Operational and Management Tooling Considerations

   The operational community's ability to effectively adopt and use new
   specifications is significantly influenced by the availability and
   adaptability of appropriate tooling.  In this context, "tools" refers
   to software systems or utilities used by network operators to deploy,
   configure, monitor, troubleshoot, and manage networks or network
   protocols in real-world operational environments.  While the
   introduction of a new specification does not automatically mandate
   the development of entirely new tools, careful consideration must be
   given to how existing tools can be leveraged or extended to support
   the management and operation of these new specifications.

   The [NEMOPS] workshop highlighted a consistent theme applicable
   beyond network management protocols: the "ease of use" and
   adaptability of existing tools are critical factors for successful
   adoption.  Therefore, a new specification should provide examples
   using existing, common tooling, or running code that demonstrate how
   to perform key operational tasks.

   Specifically, the following tooling-related aspects should be
   considered, prioritizing the adaptation of existing tools:

   *  Leveraging Existing Tooling: Before considering new tools, assess
      whether existing tooling, such as monitoring systems, logging
      platforms, configuration management systems, and/or orchestration
      frameworks, can be adapted to support the new specification.  This
      may involve developing plugins, modules, or drivers that enable
      these tools to interact with the new specification.

   *  Extending Existing Tools: Identify areas where existing tools can
      be extended to provide the necessary visibility and control over
      the new specification.  For example, if a new transport protocol
      is introduced, consider whether existing network monitoring tools
      can be extended to track its performance metrics or whether
      existing security tools can be adapted to analyze its traffic
      patterns.

   *  New Tools: Only when existing tools are demonstrably inadequate
      for managing and operating the elements of the new specification
      should the development of new tools be considered.  In such cases,
      carefully define the specific requirements for these new tools,
      focusing on the functionalities that cannot be achieved through
      adaptation or extension of existing solutions.

   *  IETF Hackathons for Manageability Testing: IETF Hackathons
      [IETF-HACKATHONS] provide an opportunity to test the
      functionality, interoperability, and manageability of New
      Protocols.  These events can be specifically leveraged to assess
      the operational (including manageability) implications of a New
      Protocol by focusing tasks on:

      -  Adapting existing tools to interact with the new specification.

      -  Developing example management scripts or modules for existing
         management platforms.

      -  Testing the specification's behavior under various operational
         conditions.

      -  Identifying potential tooling gaps and areas for improvement.

      -  Creating example flows and use cases for manageability.

   *  Open-Source for Tooling: If new tools are deemed necessary, or if
      significant adaptations to existing tools are required, prioritize
      open-source development with community involvement.  Open-source
      tools lower the barrier to entry, encourage collaboration, and
      provide operators with the flexibility to customize and extend the
      tools to meet their specific needs.

6.  Documentation Guidelines

   This document outlines key considerations for Protocol Designers and
   provides guidance on how these considerations ought to be documented.

   This document does not describe interoperability requirements but
   rather describes practices that are useful to follow when dealing
   with operational and manageability aspects in IETF documents, so the
   capitalized keywords from [RFC2119] do not apply here.  Any
   occurrence of words like 'must' or 'should' needs to be interpreted
   only in the context of their natural, English-language meaning.

6.1.  Recommended Discussions

   After evaluating the operational and manageability aspects of a
   protocol, a Protocol Extension, or an architecture, the resulting
   practices and requirements should be documented in an "Operations and
   Manageability Considerations" section within a specification.  Since
   protocols are intended for operational deployment and management
   within real networks, it is expected that such considerations will be
   present.

   It is also recommended that operational and manageability
   considerations be addressed early in the protocol design process.
   Consequently, early revisions of Internet-Drafts are expected to
   include an "Operations and Manageability Considerations" section.

   It is also recommended to begin considering operational and
   manageability considerations early within the protocol design, and
   consequently it is expected that early revisions of Internet-Drafts
   will contain such section.

   An "Operations and Manageability Considerations" section should
   include discussion of the management and operations topics raised in
   this document, and when one or more of these topics is not relevant,
   it would be useful to contain a simple statement explaining why the
   topic is not relevant or applicable for the New Protocol or feature.
   Of course, additional relevant operational and manageability topics
   should be included as well.

   Existing protocols and Data Models can provide the management
   functions identified in the previous section.  Protocol Designers
   should consider how using existing protocols and Data Models might
   impact network operations.

6.2.  Null Operations and Manageability Considerations Section

   A Protocol Designer should consider the manageability requirements of
   a New Protocol or Protocol Extension and determine that no management
   functionality or operational best-practice clarifications are needed
   by the protocol.  It would be helpful to those who may update or
   write extensions to the protocol in the future, or to those deploying
   the protocol, to know the rationale regarding the decisions on
   manageability of the protocol at the time of its design.

   If there are no new manageability or deployment considerations, it is
   recommended that an "Operations and Manageability Considerations"
   section contain a simple statement such as, "There are no new
   operations or manageability requirements introduced by this
   document," followed by a brief explanation of why that is the case.
   The presence of such a section would indicate to the reader that due
   consideration has been given to manageability and operations.

   In cases where the New Protocol is an extension and the base protocol
   already addresses the relevant operational and manageability
   considerations, it is helpful to reference the considerations section
   in the base document.

6.3.  Placement of Operations and Manageability Considerations Sections

   It is recommended that the section be placed immediately before the
   Security Considerations section.  Reviewers interested in such
   sections will find it easily, and this placement could simplify the
   development of tools to detect the presence of such a section.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not have any IANA actions required.

8.  Operations and Manageability Considerations

   Although this document focuses on operations and manageability
   guidance, it does not define a New Protocol, a Protocol Extension, or
   an Architecture.  As such, there are no new operations or
   manageability requirements introduced by this document.

9.  Security Considerations

   This document is informational and provides guidelines for
   considering manageability and operations.  It introduces no new
   security concerns.

   The provision of a management portal to a network device provides a
   doorway through which an attack on the device may be launched.
   Making the protocol under development be manageable through a
   management protocol creates a vulnerability to a new source of
   attacks.  Only management protocols with adequate security apparatus,
   such as authentication, message integrity checking, and
   authorization, should be used.

   A standard description of the manageable knobs and whistles on a
   protocol makes it easier for an attacker to understand what they may
   try to control and how to tweak it.

   A well-designed protocol is usually more stable and secure.  A
   protocol that can be managed and inspected offers the operator a
   better chance of spotting and quarantining any attacks.  Conversely,
   making a protocol easy to inspect is a risk if the wrong person
   inspects it.

   If security events cause logs and/or notifications/alerts, a
   concerted attack might be able to be mounted by causing an excess of
   these events.  In other words, the security-management mechanisms
   could constitute a security vulnerability.  The management of
   security aspects is important (see Section 4.7).

Acknowledgements

   The authors wish to thank the following individuals and groups.

   The IETF Ops Directorate:  The IETF Ops Directorate [IETF-OPS-Dir]
      reviewer team, who has been providing document reviews for over a
      decade, and its Chairs, Gunter Van de Velde, Carlos Pignataro, and
      Bo Wu.

   The AD championing the update:  Med Boucadair initiated the effort to
      refresh RFC 5706, 15 years after its publication, building on an
      idea originally suggested by Carlos Pignataro.

   The author of RFC 5706:  David Harrington

   Acknowledgments from RFC 5706:  This document started from an earlier
      document edited by Adrian Farrel, which itself was based on work
      exploring the need for Manageability Considerations sections in
      all Internet-Drafts produced within the Routing Area of the IETF.
      That earlier work was produced by Avri Doria, Loa Andersson, and
      Adrian Farrel, with valuable feedback provided by Pekka Savola and
      Bert Wijnen.

      Some of the discussion about designing for manageability came from
      private discussions between Dan Romascanu, Bert Wijnen, Jürgen
      Schönwälder, Andy Bierman, and David Harrington.

      Thanks to reviewers who helped fashion this document, including
      Harald Alvestrand, Ron Bonica, Brian Carpenter, Benoît Claise,
      Adrian Farrel, David Kessens, Dan Romascanu, Pekka Savola, Jürgen
      Schönwälder, Bert Wijnen, Ralf Wolter, and Lixia Zhang.
