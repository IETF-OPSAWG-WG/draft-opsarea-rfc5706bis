This abstraction supports different data model implementations\u2014such as YANG, IPFIX [RFC7011], gMNI, or SNMPv3 [RFC3411]\u2014while maintaining semantic consistency across them. Using YANG for the information model enables this abstraction, leverages the community's familiarity with its syntax, and ensures a lossless and consistent mapping to its corresponding YANG data model. \n4\uff09Structure\nTo make the abstract information model clearer, it is recommended to use the YANG Tree Diagram defined in RFC 8340. It provides a simple and standardized way to show the structure of the model without being tied to any specific implementation. Furthermore, to ensure alignment between the abstract model and its concrete realizations.\nThe information model draft should include at least one corresponding data model (see draft-ietf-opsawg-discardmodel for the IM writing method).

Require that all objects be essential for management.\n3. Consider evidence of current use of the managed protocol, and the perceived utility of objects added to the information model.\n4.

When defining an information model in YANG [RFC7950] with Data Structure Extensions [RFC8791] (thereby keeping it abstract and implementation-agnostic per [RFC3444]) ensure that the module remains simple, modular, and clear by following the authoring guidelines in [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].\n7.

However, I have a few questions to work through before recommending publication:\n> \n> The document is still strongly influenced by its genesis in routing. It is easy to see how to apply its advice when it is natural to talk about an application or a deployment in terms of the protocol, particularly when a configuration action on a network element maps directly into a configuration action in the protocol.\n> \n> **It is less obvious how to apply much of the advice when the protocol is a component or framework - when there are layers between the outward interface of the managed elements and the knobs in the protocols (TLS, SASL, S/MIME, PIDF, PIDF-LO, RTP, ...). Would it be possible to add guidance on how to apply the recommendations in those kinds of documents?** Would it make sense to add/make more explicit a discussion on reveiwing managability of the interfaces that components expose to the to-be-managed applications that are going to use them?\n> \n> Similarly, some of the \"link\", \"node\", and \"packet\" vocabulary becomes awkward when you start applying this to protocols that are higher in the stack. Can the language be abstracted to make it clearer what consideration discussion you're trying to stimulate in those cases?\n> \n> I can be talked into waiting for future documents to address those concerns - the guidance here for the protocols that the recommendations can easily be applied to is worth publishing as soon as we can. But we need to address the above questions before we start to consider _requiring_ these considerations in all submissions.\n\n> [Ballot comment]\n> The last paragraph of 2.2 could be generalized - speed is not the only thing that time changes.\n> \n> The guidance in the last paragraph before section 3.1 starts should also point to the cases where focusing on instumenting servers might mask problems - instrumentation in clients may be the only thing that can provide information to the operator.\n> \n> In section 3.1 \"Information models should come from the protocol WGs\" -- not all protocols come from WGs.\n> \n> \"some planned companion documents\" is a phrase that will not age well once this is in RFC-stone. Can it be replaced with something a little less time-sensitive?\n> \n> Consider changing the \"must not\" on the second line of page 9 to \"MUST NOT\" (or not).",

However, one proposed change:\n\nIn {#sec-impact}\nOLD\n   The impact on performance may also be noted -- increased delay or\n   jitter in real-time traffic applications, or increased response time\n   in client-server applications when encryption or filtering are\n   applied.\nNEW\n   The impact of New Protocols or Protocol Extensions, and the results \n   of new OAM tools developed for the New Protocols or Protocol\n   Extensions, must be considered with respect to the performance of\n   traffic delivery and the availability of ongoing manageability. For\n   example, it must be noted if the New Protocols or Protocol Extensions\n   or the OAM tools cause increased delay or jitter in real-time traffic\n   applications, or increased response time in client-server\n   applications. Further, if the additional traffic caused by OAM tools\n   and data collection could result in the management plane becoming \n   swamped, then this must be called out, and suitable mechanisms to\n   rate limit the OAM must be provided. Consider three examples: in \n   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection for MPLS {{?RFC5884}} it is \n   possible to configure very rapid BFD transmissions (of the order of\n   3ms) on a very large number of parallel Label Switched Paths (LSPs)\n   with the result that the management systems and end nodes may become \n   overwhelmed -- this can be protected by limiting applying limits to \n   the number of LSPs that may be tested at once; notifications or logs\n   from systems (through YANG or other means) should be rate-limited so\n   that they do not flood the receiving management station; the \n   application of sophisticated encryption or filtering rules need to\n   be considered in the light of the additional processing they may\n   impose on the \"fast path\" for traffic.\nEND",

I also have the following comments for your consideration,\n> \n> \n> 1) In Section 2.1, there is   \"Operation activities that are undertaken to keep the network.\"\n> \n> It seems that this sentence is incomplete, can it be changed to the following or something like that?\n>   \"Operation activities that are undertaken to keep the network run normally.\"\n> \n> 2) Section 2.2 mentions Radius as a management technology, Based on RFC2865  \"Radius is a protocol for carrying authentication,  authorization, and configuration information between a Network Access\u201d\n>  \n> However, I think the  term of \"management\" in this document is mainly about how to manage \u201cNew Protocols or Protocol Extensions\uff0cI don't think Radius belongs to this categoy,  so it is not related to the subject of this document. \n> \n> 3) In section 3.2,  there is \"There are no new operations or manageability requirements introduced by this document,\"\n> \n> Since RFC5706-bis mainly deals the mangement and operation issus of new standard, instead of new draft , so it is possible to be changed to the following?\n> \"There are no specific operations or manageability requirements introduced by this protocol (or protocol extension),\"\n> \n> 4) In Section 5, there is  \n> \"The management model should take into account factors such as: What type of management entities will be involved (agents, network management systems)?\"\n> \n> I propose to add \"network Controller\" to the list, so the setence is change to \"The management model should take into account factors such as: What type of management entities will be involved (agents, network controller, network management systems)?\"\n> \n> 5) Section 5.3 is about fault management, \n> \n> With the increasing number of protocols in the network, operators are particularly concerned about the stability and impact of new protocols (including extensions of existing protocols). They are concerned about whether issuing protocol configuration instructions will have an impact on the normal operation of the network. The impact of different protocols on network stability and security varies during deployment. Improper configuration of one instruction may lead to widespread network failures and even serious losses. Therefore, it is recommended to analyze and explain the possible impact of new protocols or extensions, if there is a fault, What is its impact level (single-device level, AS level, operator level, neighour operators level,  or the whole Internet)?  and provide necessary reminders in the documentation on how to avoid such wrong configurations.\n> \n> 6) Section 5.6.1 is about the performance management of protocol. I think performance is heavily decided by the resource provided, in particular, hardware resource provided, for instance, for the same protocol, hardware based implementation usually has better performance than that of software-based, so I think the term of \"performance\" works for equipment, instead of protocol. Since this draft is about how to write\u201c Considering Operations and Management in IETF specifications\u201d, from the perspective of protocol, do we need to keep the section of perfromance\uff1f \n> \n> 7) Section 6 is about\"Operational and Management Tooling Considerations\", I suggest adding AI-based system here\uff0csuch as AI agent.\n> \n> This is because the adoption of AI technology in network management and operation has become an important trend. Considering that an RFC will serve for many years in the future, we should mention it in this section.\n> \n> 8) The purpose of RFC5706-bis is to instruct authors on how to write \"Considering Operations and Management\" in their IETF standard. Currently, its length is a bit long, and in order to facilitate its use, I suggest that the final version can reduce its length and mainly list instructions on how to write \"considerations\". Analytical or supportive content can be moved to the auxiliary section.\n> \n> \n> \n> Thank you!\n> \n> \n> Best regards\n> Chongfeng",

          "body": "The other artifact the AI spit out was these suggestions.  Some of which are useless, but others are useful and likely things we wanted to do anyway.\n\n## Suggestions for Shortening the Original Document (`draft-opsarea-rfc5706bis.txt`)\n\nTo significantly reduce the length of the original document and improve its readability and adoption, consider the following strategies:\n\n1.  **Adopt a Question-Based Structure:**\n    *   Refactor the detailed prose of Sections 4, 5, and 6 into a concise list of high-level questions, similar to the \"Core Questions\" section provided in the new draft above.\n    *   Instruct authors that if the answer to a question is non-trivial, they should provide the detailed explanation in a sub-section within their \"Operational Considerations\" section, rather than having the guidelines document itself provide exhaustive examples for every scenario. This shifts the burden of detail to the specification being written.\n\n2.  **Create a Separate \"Companion Guide\" or \"Best Practices\" Document:**\n    *   Move much of the extensive explanatory text, detailed examples (e.g., BGP flap damping, RSVP Router Alert, TCP RTT/RTTVAR, cryptographic key handling, ACL reordering, specific MIB module issues), and in-depth discussions of *why* certain considerations are important into a separate, more detailed companion document.\n    *   The main RFC (`rfc5706bis`) would then serve as a high-level reference, pointing to the companion guide for deeper understanding and specific examples.\n\n3.  **Externalize the \"Checklist\":**\n    *   The document already mentions `[CHECKLIST]`. Fully separate this into a standalone, living document (e.g., on GitHub) that can be updated more frequently than an RFC. The main RFC should simply reference this checklist as a tool for reviewers and authors.\n\n4.  **Streamline Terminology:**\n    *   Reduce the \"Terminology\" section to only the most essential terms directly used and defined within the concise guidelines. For terms that are well-defined in other RFCs, simply provide the reference without repeating the full definition (e.g., for \"Anomaly,\" \"Cause,\" \"Fault,\" \"Problem,\" \"Probable Root Cause\").\n\n5.  **Condense General Introduction and Scope:**\n    *   Make the \"Introduction\" and \"This Document\" sections more direct and succinct, focusing on the purpose and scope of the guidelines without extensive background narrative.\n\n6.  **Summarize Management Technologies:**\n    *   In \"Available Management Technologies\" (Section 5.1), instead of describing each technology (SNMP, NETCONF, RESTCONF, IPFIX, syslog), briefly state that IETF provides various standardized management protocols and refer to a dedicated overview document like [RFC6632] for details.\n\n7.  **Refer to Dedicated YANG Guidelines:**\n    *   For detailed YANG Data Model Considerations (Section 5.3.2) and Information Model Design (Section 5.3.1), primarily refer to the existing and evolving YANG authoring guidelines like `[I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis]` rather than duplicating extensive advice within this document. Keep only the high-level questions about *what type* of YANG model to consider.\n\n8.  **Selective Informative References:**\n    *   Review the \"Informative References\" section and drastically reduce it. Include only references directly cited in the concise text or those absolutely foundational to the understanding of the core guidelines. Many current references are for specific examples or deeper dives that would be more appropriate for a companion guide.\n\n9.  **Compact Acknowledgements and Contributors:**\n    *   While important, these sections can be formatted more compactly to save space.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the `draft-opsarea-rfc5706bis.txt` could be transformed into a highly readable and actionable document well within the 15-page target, making it more effective for its intended audience.",

The one and only thing that came to me from an applications perspective is the need to address internationalization considerations for human interactions. Unfortunately, there are no published guidelines for writing an \"Internationalization Considerations\" section, but there is some guidance in RFC 6365/BCP 166 that can be helpful. Here's an example of such a section found in Standard 69 (meaning that it passed multiple IETF last calls and IESG evaluations):\n \nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5730.html#section-5\n \nI hope this helps! I need to warn you, though - i18n is a touchy subject because it's one of those things for which we don't have a lot of expertise in the IETF, but the need is great, and that often leads to confusion. Including it in the draft will draw attention that you need to be prepared for.\n\nWe used to have an i18n directorate in the applications area. It was disbanded a few years ago, with the members (including me) being absorbed into a larger APPAREA review team. People are still available to help. Just be prepared to deal with some deep discussions.\n\n```\n\nSuggestion:\nWe add something small like...\n\n```\nWhere protocol specifications result in messages (such as errors or warnings) being carried as text strings or output for consumption by human operators, consideration should be given to making it possible for implementations to be configured so that the messages can be viewed in the local language. In such cases, it may be helpful to transmit a specific message code (i.e., a number) along with the default English language message, so that implementations may easily map the code to a local text string.\n\nFurther discussion of Internationalization issues may be found in [BCP166].\n```",

The design did consider the existence\n   of BGP path exploration / slow convergence with the inclusion of\n   full BGP path in the stored information.  A specific vendor with\n   memory constrained routers chose to interpret this requirement as\n   optional in their implementation.  Thererfore, in real operations,\n   path exploration caused false flap damping, resulting in loss of\n   reachability.  As a result, many networks turned flap damping off.\n\nThe specific vendor was Cisco which at the time had routers with as little as 4MB\nof memory in the field.  Storing only the prefix and not the full path was seen as \nhaving less impact on their very limited memory.  Cisco has quite a megaphone and\n were able to blame the standard even though lead developers participating\n in IETF (mostly Tony Li, but others) were very explicitly told that their implementation\n was not compliant and would result in path exploration false positives.  Much\n of the industry at the time viewed any Cisco implementation\n (of any protocol, including BGP itself) as a defacto standard even if not adherent to IETF standards.\n\n  RFC2439:\n\n   The AS path is generally included in order to identify downstream\n   instability which is not being damped or not being sufficiently\n   damped and is alternating between a stable and an unstable path.\n   Under rare circumstances it may be desirable to exclude AS path for\n   all or a subset of prefixes.\n\nNote that RFC2439 explicitly points to the need for AS path to cover the case\n of \"alternating between a stable and an unstable path\" aka path exploration.  \nFollowing the rare circumstances statement is a discussion truncating the AS path for AS sets. \n At no point in the document is it implied that an implementation that does not store AS path\n at all would work and it is explictly stated why it would not work.\n\nCurtis\n\n```",

It was designed to block\n   high-frequency route flaps; however, the design did not consider the\n   existence of BGP path exploration / slow convergence.  In real\n   operations, path exploration caused false flap damping, resulting in\n   loss of reachability.  As a result, many networks turned flap damping\n   off.\n\n  NEW:\n\n   BGP flap damping [RFC2439] is an example.  It was designed to block\n   high-frequency route flaps.  The design did consider the existence\n   of BGP path exploration / slow convergence with the inclusion of\n   full BGP path in the stored information.  A specific vendor with\n   memory constrained routers chose to interpret this requirement as\n   optional in their implementation.  Thererfore, in real operations,\n   path exploration caused false flap damping, resulting in loss of\n   reachability.  As a result, many networks turned flap damping off.\n\nThe specific vendor was Cisco which at the time had routers with as\nlittle as 4MB of memory in the field.  Storing only the prefix and not\nthe full path was seen as having less impact on their very limited\nmemory.  Cisco has quite a megaphone and were able to blame the\nstandard even though lead developers participating in IETF (mostly\nTony Li, but others) were very explicitly told that their\nimplementation was not compliant and would result in path exploration\nfalse positives.  Much of the industry at the time viewed any Cisco\nimplementation (of any protocol, including BGP itself) as a defacto\nstandard even if not adherent to IETF standards.\n\n  RFC2439:\n\n   The AS path is generally included in order to identify downstream\n   instability which is not being damped or not being sufficiently\n   damped and is alternating between a stable and an unstable path.\n   Under rare circumstances it may be desirable to exclude AS path for\n   all or a subset of prefixes.\n\nNote that RFC2439 explicitly points to the need for AS path to cover\nthe case of \"alternating between a stable and an unstable path\" aka\npath exploration.  Following the rare circumstances statement is a\ndiscussion truncating the AS path for AS sets.  At no point in the\ndocument is it implied that an implementation that does not store AS\npath at all would work and it is explictly stated why it would not\nwork.\n\nCurtis\n",

Verifying Correct Operation\n\n   Protocol Designers should consider techniques for testing the effect\n   that the protocol has had on the network by sending data through the\n   network and observing its behavior (a.k.a., active monitoring).\n   Protocol Designers should consider how the correct end- to-end\n   operation of the New Protocol or Protocol Extension in the network\n   can be tested actively and passively, and how the correct data or\n   forwarding plane function of each network element can be verified to\n   be working properly with the New Protocol or Protocol Extension.\n   Which metrics are of interest?\n\n   Having simple protocol status and health indicators on network\n   devices is a recommended means to check correct operation.\n```\n\n```\n5.5.1.  Verifying Correct Operation\n\n   An important function that should be provided is guidance on how to\n   verify the correct operation of a protocol.  A Protocol Designer\n   could suggest techniques for testing the impact of the protocol on\n   the network before it is deployed as well as techniques for testing\n   the effect that the protocol has had on the network after being\n   deployed.\n\n   Protocol Designers should consider how to test the correct end-to-end\n   operation of the service or network, how to verify the correct\n   functioning of the protocol, and whether that is verified by testing\n   the service function and/or by testing the forwarding function of\n   each network element.

In the past,\r\nmost of the existing IETF management standards were focused on using Structure of\r\nManagement Information (SMI)-based data models (MIB modules) to monitor and manage\r\nnetworking devices.\r\nCurrently, the YANG data modeling language {{?RFC7950}} is recommended to\r\nmonitor and manage the IETF protocols and the networking devices.\r\n\r\nWith the following sentences to be placed somewhere else?\r\nThe discussion of emerging sets of management requirements has a long history\r\nin the IETF. The set of management protocols you should use depends\r\non what you are managing.\r\n",

For example, such a decision can be taken when it is given that the data component is not used by distinct protocols (e.g., IPFIX-only).\r\n   \r\n   Alternatively, Protocol Designers may decide to use an information model to describe the managed elements in a protocol or protocol extension. The protocol designers then use the information model to develop data models that will be used for managing the protocol. \r\n   \r\n   Specifically, Protocol Designers should develop an information model if multiple data model representations (e.g., YANG {{?RFC6020}}{{?RFC7950}} and/or IPFIX {{?RFC7011}}) are to be produced, to ensure lossless semantic mapping.

When I read\r\n   Currently, the YANG data modeling language {{?RFC7950}} is recommended to\r\n   monitor and manage the IETF protocols, networks, and underlying devices.\r\n   Management requirements continually evolve in the IETF. Therefore,\r\n   the management protocols used should track with current IETF\r\n   recommendations.\r\n\r\nI am wondering: IETF protocols, networks, and underlying devices ... but what about services? \r\nYANG is used for services, but the sentence is \"is recommended ...\". \r\nThe only recommendation I can think of is: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/statement-iesg-writable-mib-module-iesg-statement-20140302/ and it does not make specific call to \"service\"\r\n\r\nBottom: should be add service to \"is recommended to monitor and manage the IETF protocols, networks, and underlying devices\"",

Well b/c NMOP could not agree...\r\n\r\nDoes it make Root Cause a candidate for removal? I guess so.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

On on side, the NMOP consensus was NOT to define that term. On the other side, the terminology fairy Adrian and the NMOP co-chair introduce it into another document. This does seem right, we can not say we were not aware. \r\n\r\nThis Root Cause is going to painfully come back at us at review time, I believe.\r\n\r\nLet's discuss today",

Causality is defined as the\r\n      implementation of an inductive process at the network or\r\n      processing element level [ITU-T-G-7710] and as a doubt removal\r\n      process at the Incident management system level [ITU-T-X-733].\r\n      The inductive process is based on the distinction made between\r\n      _primary failures_ (i.e., a failure that directly indicates the\r\n      fault location and initiate a repair action, such as a broken\r\n      cable or a misconnection) and _secondary failures_ (i.e., a\r\n      consequential failure, such as an upper level service that has\r\n      gone down) [ITU-T-G-7710].\r\n\r\n      Conversely, a causal factor is a contributing action that\r\n      influences the outcome of an incident or event but is not the\r\n      probably cause.\r\n\r\nWhat if we replace \"root cause\" from RFC5706 by \"probable cause\", with a reference to this term in the NMOP document.

I just worry that we'll collide with evolving security guidelines.\r\n\r\nYeah, I see your point. Since this is a cryptographic algorithm, the operational considerations section reflects the key formats and potential testing, while the security considerations explain why those formats and structures are secure. To help differentiate what falls outside of operational considerations; The boundaries are not always strict, but it's useful to separate:\r\n\r\n- \u201cHow to do it\u201d \u2192 Operational Considerations\r\n- \u201cWhy it's safe\u201d \u2192 Security Consideration\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll open an issue so we can discuss it during the meeting.",

And I don't see that changes in the text.  I'd like to propose a sentence or two about it. \r\n\r\nLooking in more details, I see\r\nRFC 5706: \"The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to authors and\r\n   reviewers of documents that define new protocols or protocol\r\n   extensions regarding aspects of operations and management that should\r\n   be considered.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the current draft, \"\"The OPS Directorate can use this document to guide performing reviews. A list of guidelines and a checklist of questions to consider, which a reviewer can use to evaluate whether the protocol and documentation address common operations and management needs, is provided in {{CHECKLIST}}.\"\r\n\r\nSo I am not sure any longer... but I wanted to express that the OPS-DIR checklist is moved out of the document.

Operators may require new tooling or methods for managing network traffic in response to protocol changes to ensure consistent availability and performance of networks. Similarly, updating and augmenting existing forensic tools such as protocol dissectors is expected when a New Protocol is deployed, but having to completely rebuild such tooling would greatly reduce the effectiveness of security operators, so protocol extensibility should be considered.\"\r\n\r\nYour statement is certainly correct but should be included in the \"operational considerations\" section?

I agree that the definition does not need to be revised, but for the sake of readability and clarity, I understand that the entire draft uses different expressions. I think the entire draft needs to be revised based on the principle that \"Protocol Designer represents an individual, and Protocol Designers represent a group of people.\" Plese check the update.

It's being used in several spots in technical groups of the IETF and IRTF (such as aipref and nmrg).  That said, it may be ill-defined here.  I couldn't find a canonical definition to which IETF documents refer.  They simply refer to AI and then describe some of its characteristics.  And that is the goal here.  To put forth considerations on what training and inference for these AI models might mean when it comes to protocol design.",
