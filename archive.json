Fault management is, therefore, the process\n      of interpreting fault notifications and other alerts and alarms, isolating faults, \n      correlating them, and decucing underlying causes. See {{sec-fm-mgt}} for more\n      information.\n\n   *  Anomaly: {{?I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology}} defines an anomaly as an unusual or\n      unexpected event or pattern in network data in the forwarding plane, control plane, or\n      management plane that deviates from the normal, expected behavior. This is discussed\n      further in {{?I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture}}.\n\n   *  Cause and Root cause: A cause is the event (or events) that gave rise to a fault or problem\n      ({{?I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology}}).

Another relevant reference is RFC 6123 Section 3.2, it appears outdated due to its MIB/SNMP focus. \n\nBenoit kindly pointed out two recent drafts discussed in OPSAWG that may serve as relevant examples:\ndraft-ietf-opsawg-discardmodel \u2013 first attempt to use YANG as an information model language\ndraft-evans-opsawg-ipfix-discard-class-ie\nBelow is my initial proposed structure for the section, and I\u2019d very much appreciate feedback or suggestions from the group before proceeding to draft actual text:\n\nInformation Model\n1\uff09Brief explanation of what an Information Model (IM) is\uff0creferencing RFC 3444\n2\uff09Clarification of the difference between IM and Data Model (DM), referencing RFC 3444\n3\uff09As described in draft-ietf-opsawg-discardmodel, the information model is defined using YANG [RFC7950], with Data\n Structure Extensions [RFC8791]\uff0cfollowing the guidance of [RFC3444] to remain abstract and decoupled from specific implementations.  This abstraction supports different data model implementations\u2014such as YANG, IPFIX [RFC7011], gMNI, or SNMPv3 [RFC3411]\u2014while maintaining semantic consistency across them. Using YANG for the information model enables this abstraction, leverages the community's familiarity with its syntax, and ensures a lossless and consistent mapping to its corresponding YANG data model. \n4\uff09Structure\nTo make the abstract information model clearer, it is recommended to use the YANG Tree Diagram defined in RFC 8340. It provides a simple and standardized way to show the structure of the model without being tied to any specific implementation. Furthermore, to ensure alignment between the abstract model and its concrete realizations.\nThe information model draft should include at least one corresponding data model (see draft-ietf-opsawg-discardmodel for the IM writing method). If there are additional implementations, such as IPFIX, it should be included in the same document to maintain consistency and provide a complete reference for implementers.",

Start with a small set of essential objects and make additions only as further objects are needed with the objective of keeping the total number of objects as small as possible.\n2.  Require that all objects be essential for management.\n3. Consider evidence of current use of the managed protocol, and the perceived utility of objects added to the information model.\n4.  Exclude objects that can be derived from others in this or other information models.\n5.  Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily instrumented.  A\nguideline is one counter per critical section per layer.\n6. When defining an information model in YANG [RFC7950] with Data Structure Extensions [RFC8791] (thereby keeping it abstract and implementation-agnostic per [RFC3444]) ensure that the module remains simple, modular, and clear by following the authoring guidelines in [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].\n7. When illustrating the abstract information model, use the YANG tree diagram from RFC 8340 to provide a simple, standardized, and implementation-neutral model structure.\n\n[draft-opsarea-rfc5706bis-00--IM related content.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20180701/draft-opsarea-rfc5706bis-00--IM.related.content.docx)",

When I read\r\n   Currently, the YANG data modeling language {{?RFC7950}} is recommended to\r\n   monitor and manage the IETF protocols, networks, and underlying devices.\r\n   Management requirements continually evolve in the IETF. Therefore,\r\n   the management protocols used should track with current IETF\r\n   recommendations.\r\n\r\nI am wondering: IETF protocols, networks, and underlying devices ... but what about services? \r\nYANG is used for services, but the sentence is \"is recommended ...\". \r\nThe only recommendation I can think of is: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/statement-iesg-writable-mib-module-iesg-statement-20140302/ and it does not make specific call to \"service\"\r\n\r\nBottom: should be add service to \"is recommended to monitor and manage the IETF protocols, networks, and underlying devices\"",
