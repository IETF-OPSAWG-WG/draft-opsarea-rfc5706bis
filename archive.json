This abstraction supports different data model implementations\u2014such as YANG, IPFIX [RFC7011], gMNI, or SNMPv3 [RFC3411]\u2014while maintaining semantic consistency across them. Using YANG for the information model enables this abstraction, leverages the community's familiarity with its syntax, and ensures a lossless and consistent mapping to its corresponding YANG data model. \n4\uff09Structure\nTo make the abstract information model clearer, it is recommended to use the YANG Tree Diagram defined in RFC 8340. It provides a simple and standardized way to show the structure of the model without being tied to any specific implementation. Furthermore, to ensure alignment between the abstract model and its concrete realizations.\nThe information model draft should include at least one corresponding data model (see draft-ietf-opsawg-discardmodel for the IM writing method).

Require that all objects be essential for management.\n3. Consider evidence of current use of the managed protocol, and the perceived utility of objects added to the information model.\n4.  Exclude objects that can be derived from others in this or other information models.\n5.  Avoid causing critical sections to be heavily instrumented.  A\nguideline is one counter per critical section per layer.\n6. When defining an information model in YANG [RFC7950] with Data Structure Extensions [RFC8791] (thereby keeping it abstract and implementation-agnostic per [RFC3444]) ensure that the module remains simple, modular, and clear by following the authoring guidelines in [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].\n7.

It is easy to see how to apply its advice when it is natural to talk about an application or a deployment in terms of the protocol, particularly when a configuration action on a network element maps directly into a configuration action in the protocol.\n> \n> **It is less obvious how to apply much of the advice when the protocol is a component or framework - when there are layers between the outward interface of the managed elements and the knobs in the protocols (TLS, SASL, S/MIME, PIDF, PIDF-LO, RTP, ...). Would it be possible to add guidance on how to apply the recommendations in those kinds of documents?** Would it make sense to add/make more explicit a discussion on reveiwing managability of the interfaces that components expose to the to-be-managed applications that are going to use them?\n> \n> Similarly, some of the \"link\", \"node\", and \"packet\" vocabulary becomes awkward when you start applying this to protocols that are higher in the stack. Can the language be abstracted to make it clearer what consideration discussion you're trying to stimulate in those cases?\n> \n> I can be talked into waiting for future documents to address those concerns - the guidance here for the protocols that the recommendations can easily be applied to is worth publishing as soon as we can. But we need to address the above questions before we start to consider _requiring_ these considerations in all submissions.\n\n> [Ballot comment]\n> The last paragraph of 2.2 could be generalized - speed is not the only thing that time changes.\n> \n> The guidance in the last paragraph before section 3.1 starts should also point to the cases where focusing on instumenting servers might mask problems - instrumentation in clients may be the only thing that can provide information to the operator.\n> \n> In section 3.1 \"Information models should come from the protocol WGs\" -- not all protocols come from WGs.\n> \n> \"some planned companion documents\" is a phrase that will not age well once this is in RFC-stone. Can it be replaced with something a little less time-sensitive?\n> \n> Consider changing the \"must not\" on the second line of page 9 to \"MUST NOT\" (or not).",

I also have the following comments for your consideration,\n> \n> \n> 1) In Section 2.1, there is   \"Operation activities that are undertaken to keep the network.\"\n> \n> It seems that this sentence is incomplete, can it be changed to the following or something like that?\n>   \"Operation activities that are undertaken to keep the network run normally.\"\n> \n> 2) Section 2.2 mentions Radius as a management technology, Based on RFC2865  \"Radius is a protocol for carrying authentication,  authorization, and configuration information between a Network Access\u201d\n>  \n> However, I think the  term of \"management\" in this document is mainly about how to manage \u201cNew Protocols or Protocol Extensions\uff0cI don't think Radius belongs to this categoy,  so it is not related to the subject of this document. \n> \n> 3) In section 3.2,  there is \"There are no new operations or manageability requirements introduced by this document,\"\n> \n> Since RFC5706-bis mainly deals the mangement and operation issus of new standard, instead of new draft , so it is possible to be changed to the following?\n> \"There are no specific operations or manageability requirements introduced by this protocol (or protocol extension),\"\n> \n> 4) In Section 5, there is  \n> \"The management model should take into account factors such as: What type of management entities will be involved (agents, network management systems)?\"\n> \n> I propose to add \"network Controller\" to the list, so the setence is change to \"The management model should take into account factors such as: What type of management entities will be involved (agents, network controller, network management systems)?\"\n> \n> 5) Section 5.3 is about fault management, \n> \n> With the increasing number of protocols in the network, operators are particularly concerned about the stability and impact of new protocols (including extensions of existing protocols). They are concerned about whether issuing protocol configuration instructions will have an impact on the normal operation of the network. The impact of different protocols on network stability and security varies during deployment. Improper configuration of one instruction may lead to widespread network failures and even serious losses. Therefore, it is recommended to analyze and explain the possible impact of new protocols or extensions, if there is a fault, What is its impact level (single-device level, AS level, operator level, neighour operators level,  or the whole Internet)?  and provide necessary reminders in the documentation on how to avoid such wrong configurations.\n> \n> 6) Section 5.6.1 is about the performance management of protocol. I think performance is heavily decided by the resource provided, in particular, hardware resource provided, for instance, for the same protocol, hardware based implementation usually has better performance than that of software-based, so I think the term of \"performance\" works for equipment, instead of protocol. Since this draft is about how to write\u201c Considering Operations and Management in IETF specifications\u201d, from the perspective of protocol, do we need to keep the section of perfromance\uff1f \n> \n> 7) Section 6 is about\"Operational and Management Tooling Considerations\", I suggest adding AI-based system here\uff0csuch as AI agent.\n> \n> This is because the adoption of AI technology in network management and operation has become an important trend. Considering that an RFC will serve for many years in the future, we should mention it in this section.\n> \n> 8) The purpose of RFC5706-bis is to instruct authors on how to write \"Considering Operations and Management\" in their IETF standard. Currently, its length is a bit long, and in order to facilitate its use, I suggest that the final version can reduce its length and mainly list instructions on how to write \"considerations\". Analytical or supportive content can be moved to the auxiliary section.\n> \n> \n> \n> Thank you!\n> \n> \n> Best regards\n> Chongfeng",

As\n>     such, it does not use the capitalized keywords defined in [BCP14].\n> \n>    I agree with not using rfc2119 keywords when talking about the\n>    considerations themselves.  However, they should be used when defining\n> the\n>    specific requirements for when the Operational Considerations section is\n>    needed (see above) to avoid confusion.\n> \n> \n> (3) Null Considerations section not required?\n> \n>    \u00a73.2 (Null Operations and Manageability Considerations Section) says\n> that\n>    \"[i]f there are no new manageability or deployment considerations, it is\n>    recommended that an \"Operations and Manageability Considerations\"\n> section\n>    contain a simple statement...\"\n> \n>    Populating a null section is not required.  Does this mean that an RFC\n> can\n>    be published without Operational Considerations?  Even in the Standards\n>    Track?\n> \n> \n> (4) What is the name of the new section?  Is it one section or two?\n> \n>    The title of \u00a73.2, for example, calls out what appears to be one section\n>    (\"Operations and Manageability Considerations Section\"), but they are\n>    mentioned independently in other places.  And still in other cases, only\n>    the Operational Considerations section is mentioned (in \u00a73.1, for\n> example).\n>    Is the intent that one section covers both topics?  If so, please be\n> clear\n>    and consistent about it.\n> \n>    Also, most of the document talks about \"manageability considerations\",\n> but\n>    a couple of places use \"management considerations\".  The same for\n>    \"operations\" and \"operational\".\n> \n> \n> (5) Scope creep?\n> \n>    \u00a71.2 (Audience) mentions several potential uses of this document beyond\n>    documenting the operational and manageability considerations for New\n>    Protocols or Protocol Extensions, for example: \"Area Director who is in\n> the\n>    process of creating a new WG Charter...OPS Directorate can use this\n>    document to guide performing reviews\".

          "body": "@boucadair I like all the changes you introduced. I believe there are ready to merge.\r\n\r\nOne question, for potential discussion in our call today. When I read\r\n   Currently, the YANG data modeling language {{?RFC7950}} is recommended to\r\n   monitor and manage the IETF protocols, networks, and underlying devices.\r\n   Management requirements continually evolve in the IETF. Therefore,\r\n   the management protocols used should track with current IETF\r\n   recommendations.\r\n\r\nI am wondering: IETF protocols, networks, and underlying devices ... but what about services? \r\nYANG is used for services, but the sentence is \"is recommended ...\". \r\nThe only recommendation I can think of is: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/statement-iesg-writable-mib-module-iesg-statement-20140302/ and it does not make specific call to \"service\"\r\n\r\nBottom: should be add service to \"is recommended to monitor and manage the IETF protocols, networks, and underlying devices\"",

Since this is a cryptographic algorithm, the operational considerations section reflects the key formats and potential testing, while the security considerations explain why those formats and structures are secure. To help differentiate what falls outside of operational considerations; The boundaries are not always strict, but it's useful to separate:\r\n\r\n- \u201cHow to do it\u201d \u2192 Operational Considerations\r\n- \u201cWhy it's safe\u201d \u2192 Security Consideration\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll open an issue so we can discuss it during the meeting.",
